    <p>Pupin's 1899 patent for loading coils, archaically called "Pupin coils", followed closely
    on the pioneering work of the English polymath Oliver Heaviside, which predates Pupin's patent
    by some seven years. The importance of the patent was made clear when the American rights to 
    it were acquired by American Telephone & Telegraph (AT&T), making him wealthy.
    Although AT&T bought Pupin's patent, they made little use of it, as they already had their 
    own development in hand led by George Campbell and had up to this point been challenging
    Pupin with Campbell's own patent. AT&T were afraid they would lose control of an invention 
    which was immensely valuable due to its ability to greatly extend the range of long-distance
    telephones and especially submarine ones.</p>
