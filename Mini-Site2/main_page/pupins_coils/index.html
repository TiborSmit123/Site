                <p>Pupin's 1899 patent for loading coils, archaically called "Pupin coils", followed closely
                    on the pioneering work of the English polymath Oliver Heaviside, which predates Pupin's patent
                    by some seven years. The importance of the patent was made clear when the American rights to
                    it were acquired by American Telephone & Telegraph (AT&T), making him wealthy.
                    Although AT&T bought Pupin's patent, they made little use of it, as they already had their
                    own development in hand led by George Campbell and had up to this point been challenging
                    Pupin with Campbell's own patent. AT&T were afraid they would lose control of an invention
                    which was immensely valuable due to its ability to greatly extend the range of long-distance
                    telephones and especially submarine ones.</p>
